% Figure 1 was the test image for identifying Leukocytes. In the image, 
% there are 6 large purple blobs. These are the white blood cells; however,
% not all of these cells are the same. There are five different types of 
% white blood cells, each of which can be distinguished based on their 
% appearance: (1.) Neutrophils, (2.) Lymphocytes, (3.) Monocytes, 
% (4.) Eosinophils, and (5.) Basophils. (Note: each type is indicated on 
% the figure above.) Neutrophils can be identified by their pinched-in 
% nucleus (darker purple region) which may have a horseshoe-like 
% appearence. Lymphocytes contain a large, generally round and uniform 
% nuclues. Monocytes are distinguish from their large nuclues, similar to 
% that of Lymphocytes, except they contain more cytoplasm and their nucleus
% is a kidney bean shape. Eosinphils are similar to Neutrophils in 
% appearance, with large granules in the 
% cytoplasm. Basophils are the easiest to distinguish as they are
% characterized by large, dark purple granules. These five types of
% Leukocytes can be split into two distinct groups based on the granules; 
%
% 1.) Granulocytes - Basophil, Eosinophil, and Neutrophil
%
% 2.) Agranulocytes - Lymphocytes and Monocytes

% channels were investigated.

B = im(:,:,3); % blue channel

% Figure 2 contains the grayscale, red, green, and blue channels, of the
% image shown in figure 1. It is observered that the in the test image, the
% Leukocytes contain large intensities in the blue channel, however that is
% true of most of the image. This is indicated by the fact that the
% majority of the image is made up of lighter shades. Conversely, in the
% greyscale, red, and green channels, the Leukocytes are characterized by
% lower intensity values. The intensitivity behavior can be attributed to 
% violet color of the Leukocytes from the original image. It is noted that 
% the dark characterization however is only true for the nucleui, not the 
% cytoplasm. 


%%
%
% Using a similar process as Prinyakupt and Pluempitiwiriyawej [2],
% nucleus segmentation was first performed by averaging the red and blue
% channel intensites. This was done because the the green channel contains
% the lowest pixel intensities of the nuclues (as indicated in figure 2).
% However, after trying to replicate the rest of Prinyakupt and 
% Pluempitiwiriyawej’s algorithum (PPA), the results were not as robust as 
% initially anticipated. When using selected images from Bloodline and 
% the data set by Muhammed, there were large inaccuracies. Results varied
% substantially from not being able to identify any white blood cells, to 
% picking out way more than what should be present. This is presented 
% below with several result images without presenting the details of PPA. 
%
% Describe Images.
%
% The proposed algorithum instead uses the idea of initally applying a
% contrast enhancment to the the image, similarly to the solution
% introduced in Mohamed et al. Capitalizing on the strong violet
% colors of the nuclei, a color contrast enhancement was performed in LAB 
% color space where the luminosity value was manipulated to adjust the
% image. After adjustment, the resulting image is as follows.
%

% adjusting luminosity - using MATLAB's tutorial [#]

srgb2lab = makecform('srgb2lab');
lab2srgb = makecform('lab2srgb');
imlab = applycform(im, srgb2lab); % convert to L*a*b*

max_luminosity = 100;
L = imlab(:,:,1)/max_luminosity;

% replace the luminosity and convert
imlab_adjust = imlab;
imlab_adjust(:,:,1) = imadjust(L)*max_luminosity;
imlab_adjust = applycform(imlab_adjust, lab2srgb);

figure(3);
imshow(imlab_adjust)

%%
% 
% It is observered that the nuclei of the WBCs now appear to have a strong,
% dark blue color. Similarly to the previous procedure and due to the
% occurance of the change in color, the RGB color channels were
% investigated once again. This is presented below.
% 

imgray = rgb2gray(imlab_adjust); % grayscale image
R = imlab_adjust(:,:,1); % red channel
G = imlab_adjust(:,:,2); % green channel
B = imlab_adjust(:,:,3); % blue channel

%
% Figure 4 contains the grayscale rendition of the enhanced image in
% addition to each of the respected RBG color channels. The obtained
% results were not as expected initally as the blue channel didn't feature
% as strong of a response that was hoped for at the nuclei locations, but
% instead has a very strong effect in the area where neither red nor white
% blood cells lie. In addition, both the red and green channels contrain
% very low intensities at nucleui locations with high intensity values in
% the unoccupied areas. Using the information obtained from figure 4, a
% similar approach as PPA was deployed. As opposed to averaging the pixel 
% values, it was decided to weight red channel and divide the difference
% between the the weighted red and blue channel by the green channel so the
% only high pixel intensity values of a grayscale image would remain at the
% WBC locations. Since operations were performed using an uint8 data type
% in MATLAB, results were usually bounded by 0 or 255. However, to ensure
% that the produced intensties formed a binary image, a threshold at a
% pixel intensity of 150 was perfomed. The threshold level was determined
% during intail implementation of PPA and it was decided to use the
% threshold for the proposed algorithum as well. The resulting image after 
% channel operations and thresholding is presented below. 
%

nucl = ((1*B)-(0.75*R))./(G);
level = 150;
nuclBW = nucl > level;

imshow(nuclBW);

%%
%
% Figure 5 is the binary image after performing color channel operations
% and thresholding to the enhanced image. From inspection, all 6 Leukocytes
% remain. Although the above image produces similar results to PPA, the 
% strength of the proposed algorithum shines when using Mohamed's data set,
% which is presented in the following section.
%

%%
%
% Once the binary image was obtained, the morphalogical transformations 
% were implemented to remove both any unwanted small objects or small holes
% from the nucleui, hence both the opening and closeing processes.
% Morphologica opening is described as...... Closing on the other hand...
% The constructed algorithum is designated to be robust so a user may be
% able to adjust the structuring element sizes involved during the
% morphological processes. Ths may be changed depending on the resolution
% of the imported image(s) and the relative size of the WBS(s). The effects
% of applying morphological opening and subsequent closing are present
% below.
%

sqOpen = strel('disk',4);
nuclMorph = imopen(nuclBW,sqOpen);
sqClose = strel('disk', 4);
bw = imclose(nuclMorph,sqClose);

imshow(bw);

% Figure 6 is the morphologically transformed binary image using the
% thresheld image as an input. Based on the image obtained and comparing it
% with figure 5, it is seen that while both pixel islands and holes have
% been removed, some distinguishing characteristcs of the WBC nuclei have
% also been lost. It is desired to possibily address this issue before
% completion. Removing certain characteristics of the WBCs will be
% problematic when tryinig to perform classification of the different
% types. Despite the lost in characteristics, the proposed algorithum is
% still able to perform WBC identification (no classification presently).
% The last step of the process in the algorithum is filtering out high
% intensity objects based on their relative area in the image and a tuning
% parameter of the user corresponding to data set being used. If the high
% intensity object area is less than a certain area, the object is mapped
% to a low intensity and is not considered a WBC. Once this is done, the
% results are indicated on the original, imported image with shappening and
% relayed back to the user. The results of the described area filter and
% information presentation is demonstrated below. 

tune = 125; % user inputted value for area filtering
