This folder contains all the contents for Mitchell Phillips’ (RIN: 661060944) Final Project for ECSE 4540 – Introduction to Image Processing for the spring, 2017 semester.

wbc_demo.m should be executable without adjusting file paths or adjusting any parameters within the script. 

The contents for the folder are as follows:

articles – contains the three main journal articles used for the duration of the project and inspiration for the developed algorithms.

images – contains image banks from American Society of Hematology, Bloodline, and Mohamed’s data set.

results – excel document with complete results from 112 sample test 

wbc_functions – constrains various matlab functions used throughout the procedure. cytoplasmClassification.m and wbcNucleiIdentification.m are the final algorithms. development_functions contains previous iterations.  

written submission – pdf and doc of final report submission

wbc_demo.m – demo matlab script showcasing abilities of proposed algorithm. Should be able to open and execute the script immediately. Dependent on the images directory. Utilizes cytoplasmClassification.m and wbcNucleiIdentification.m. 

wbc_mainDev.m – matlab script used throughout development.  Dependent on the images directory and development_functions directory.
